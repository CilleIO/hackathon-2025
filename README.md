## Setup Instructions

### Backend Setup

1. Navigate to the backend directory:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment (recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Run the backend server:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

   The API will be available at `http://localhost:8000`

### Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   The app will be available at `http://localhost:3000`

## How to Use

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Backend not starting**: Ensure all dependencies are installed and port 8000 is available
2. **Frontend not connecting**: Check that the backend is running on port 8000
3. **Image upload issues**: Ensure the `uploads` directory exists and has proper permissions
4. **CORS errors**: Verify the backend CORS settings include `http://localhost:3000`

### File Permissions
Make sure the `uploads` directory has write permissions:
```bash
chmod 755 uploads/
```
